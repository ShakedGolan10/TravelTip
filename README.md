# üöÄ GIS-Based Travel Planner Application

## üéØ Project Overview

The **GIS-Based Travel Planner** is a comprehensive, full-stack web application aimed at providing users with an intuitive, interactive map-driven interface for trip planning. It leverages advanced Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology combined with modern web development. Users can discover, select, organize, and manage travel destinations through a visually engaging Kanban-style planning tool.
